= Will this Plugin work on my WordPress.com website? =

Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.org) websites.

= My Custom CSS isn't showing up =

There are several reasons this could be happening:

* Your CSS is targeting the wrong selector.

* Your CSS selectors aren't specific enough.

For instance, you may have:

	a {
		color: #f00;
	}

When you need:

	#content a {
		color: #f00;
	}

The specificity you need depends upon the CSS rules you are attempting to override.

* Your CSS isn't valid.

Please check your CSS at the [W3C CSS Validation Service](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input+with_options" "W3C CSS Validation Service").
